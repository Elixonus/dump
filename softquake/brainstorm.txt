Structure:
Crossbox mesh
Triangulation mesh (show area of each triangle compression and expansion with different colors)
Way to algorithmically connect two structures by making the adjacent nodes be as one.

Data:
Information of softbody topologies is stored in a separate javascript file "softbodies.js" that includes every
node and link pieces of data. 

Use software to generate nodes and links precomputed.

Effects:
Structure links may have a stress strain curve that is nonlinear and resembles steel.

Function:
There is a plate underneath the structure that moves with a signal with frequency pattern.
The signal of the plate and the key nodes of the structure are measured.
Simulates ONLY P WAVES.

Able to control the frequencies of the vibration signal of the plate.
Able to control the stiffness and dampening of all of the links.
Able to control the mass of all the nodes at once.

Structure is fixed rigidly to the moving base plate instead of frictionally.
