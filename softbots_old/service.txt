GOALS
=====
Travel most to the right in one iteration.

TERRAINS
========
Flat/rocky (depending on smoothing factor).

NEURAL NETWORK
==============
Input data should not include terrain parameters such as smoothing factor as the goal is to 
test softbots on different untrained terrains.
Significance of input neurons should not change with terrain change.

API
===
POST    softbots/bot - To create a bot and return the bid.
GET     softbots/bot/:bid - To get a bot with bid.
DELETE  softbots/bot/:bid - To delete a bot with bid and associated models.
POST    softbots/bot/:bid/node?m&x&y
PUT     softbots/bot/:bid/node/:nid?m&x&y
GET     softbots/bot/:bid/node/:nid
DELETE  softbots/bot/:bid/node/:nid
POST    softbots/bot/:bid/link?n1&n2&l&s&d
PUT     softbots/bot/:bid/link/:lid?n1&n2&l&s&d
GET     softbots/bot/:bid/link/:lid
DELETE  softbots/bot/:bid/link/:lid
POST    softbots/bot/:bid/model - To create a model and return the mid.
PUT     softbots/bot/:bid/model/:mid?lr - To train and save a model with mid and input of training parameters.
GET     softbots/bot/:bid/model/:mid - To get a model with mid.
DELETE  softbots/bot/:bid/model/:mid - To delete a bot with mid.

STORAGE
=======
In each bot folder there is bot.json which contains the nodes and links data.
In each model folder there is model.json which gives what scenario the corresponding bot was trained on
as well as the bot id of the current model. As well as the pytorch saved model.
